## About One Time Secrets

One Time Secrets is a small application that I built, where I wanted to flex my performance skills.
This application runs on Laravel Octane, and the internals of the framework have been optimized for its contents.
As such, the home page loads in under 2 milliseconds when the application is hot.

This project also serves as a decent coding example, as it follows good practices, and is covered by unit tests, static code analysis, and style linting.
